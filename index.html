        <h2>HISTORY OF WEBSITE</h2>
        <hr>
        <div class="para">
        <p> It has only been 20 years since the creation of the first website * In this presentation I will outline the history of websites and explain how they have evolved.
</p> <br><p>  The internet has actually been around since the 60s, however it was very simple and websites then were not invented. It was mainly used by professionals, doctors, the military, professors etc to transfer data from one computer device to another. Many ‘normal’ people did not have any internet access.
</p> <br><p>  In 1991, Tim Berness-Lee launched the first ever website. It was very simple and unfortunately only people from the European organisation of nuclear research could view it. The rest of the world was still pretty much unaware of the internet and websites until the launch of web browsers in 1993 .
</p> <br><p>  The very first website was created by hypertext coding language, therefore could 9only be created by those who knew html. The first generation websites had linear layouts, heavy text and no graphics. 
</p> <br><p>  By 1994, web designers began to add tools to html codes. Html 2 allowed for a slightly faster internet, more graphics and colour. However, coding remained very complicated. 
</p> <br><p> 1995 marked the beginning of internet explorer and flash! Website designers could then experiment with more complex concepts such as animations. Html 4 allowed for more graphics, design, colour and patterns.</p>
<br><p> In 1996, a popular website angel fire allowed for paying customers to create their own websites and eventually for free.</p> <br><p> The blogging trend of 2000 ushered in a new era for websites. A weblog or blog is another way to say a webpage. The term blog refers to a collection of blog entries, which are truly just web pages. The blogging tools like Movable Type, Blogger, and WordPress offered a mechanism for organization owners to make their websites more dynamic. In most cases, the tools were freely available. These tools utilized php code and database functionality underneath a website to dynamically serve content. The owners weren’t exposed to the complexity of the underlying system, which in turn freed them up to focus on their website content. A key feature of these tools was the ability to add a page on the fly, with the tools handling the previous complexity of creating an html page.</p>
            <br><p> Throughout the rest of the 20th century so far, we have seen the emerge of social networking, educational websites, gaming websites, illegal websites and things like YouTube which allows people to create their own kind of mini video website. Today the internet if full of DIY websites, places where ordinary people place their living online. Some even make their living from websites, for example ebay and amazon are huge international sellers, which all started with a website. Some bloggers get paid to blog if adverts are shown in their videos or on their pages, websites have evolved very quickly and will continue to do so. </p></div>
